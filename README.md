Game Description: 
2 Player (1 Player controls their character using WASD and the other uses the Arrow Keys) 
Platformer game where players have to scale a mountain from the inside.
Players move and jump onto platforms using parkour to reach the next level (3 levels total)
Advance to next level by reaching the cave entrance at the top of each level (both players have to be there)
Have to flash a flashlight to scare away bats or else the player might get bitten and lose HP

Milestone 1 Task List:
- [x] create 2 player objects
- [x] make both players controllable
    (W and Up for jumping, A and Left to move left, D and Right to move right, S and Down for flashlight)
- [x] make it so players can't move off the screen 
    (edge of screen serves as a wall and there is no wrapping)
- [x] Add gravity so that when players jump (and fall off platforms once levels are made) they fall back down
- [x] make flashlight disappear after a second or 2
  (EDIT: changed this to make flashlight stay for as long as players held on to the S or Down buttons)
