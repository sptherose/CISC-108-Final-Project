The 2-Player Platform Game

About The Game:
- This game is a 2 player game in which both players need to reach the "cave entrance" (the black circle) in order to 
beat the game. Each player has 3 hp which is displayed at the top right corner of the screen. Every time a player 
gets hit by a bat they lose 1 health. In order to avoid getting hit, the player needs to shine a flashlight that hits 
the bat to make it disappear. If either of the players reach 0 hearts then players both lose and a game over 
screen will appear.

Milestone 1 Task List:
- [x] create 2 player objects
- [x] make both players controllable
    (W and Up for jumping, A and Left to move left, D and Right to move right, S and Down for flashlight)
- [x] make it so players can't move off the screen 
    (edge of screen serves as a wall and there is no wrapping)
- [x] Add gravity so that when players jump (and fall off platforms once levels are made) they fall back down
- [x] make flashlight disappear after a second or 2
  (EDIT: changed this to make flashlight stay for as long as players held on to the S or Down buttons)
